This is the Final Project for EPI 590 R, submitted by Tasmiah Tahera Aziz.

For this project I have worked with the Pokemon dataset, retrieved from the TidyTuesday Project datasets.

Link: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-04-01

I have downloaded the pokemon_df.csv file from the link. 

#Brief description of the dataset:

The Pokemon dataset provides detailed information on 949 Pokémon, sourced from the {pokemon} R package. 
It includes 22 variables that cover a wide range of attributes for each Pokémon, such as:

Identification: Unique ID (id), species ID (species_id), and name (pokemon)
Physical characteristics: Height, weight
Base stats: HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed
Typing and color: Primary (type_1) and secondary (type_2) types, along with corresponding color schemes (color_1, color_2, color_f)
Experience and generation: Base experience (base_experience) and generation ID
Breeding information: Egg groups (egg_group_1, egg_group_2)
Media links: URLs to icon and image resources (url_icon, url_image)

The dataset includes names in both English and Brazilian Portuguese. It is already cleaned and ready for analysis.

#Note:

First run the poke-script.R and then render gotta-catch-them-all.qmd
